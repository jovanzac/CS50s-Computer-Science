sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: When the sorted files are passed code dosen't take much time but when the random or reversed files are passed, code takes much longer which all points towards bubble sort.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: the average time taken for all - reversed, random and sorted - files are around the same value which makes me inclined to believe that sort2 uses merge sort

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: The fact that all three types of files - reversed, random and sorted - takes more time in the case of sort3 when compared with sort1 and sort2 indicates the usage of selection sort
